# Parallel K-Means - Parallel Computing Project
Project for Parallel Computing course. Sequential and parallel implementations of K-Means algorithm in C++ with OpenMP 
and CUDA. The sequential K-Means version is compared with two parallel versions, tests include execution times and the 
speedup of each version.
